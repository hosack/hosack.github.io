Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, I bring 13 years of software engineering expertise, spanning audio DSP, web application development, and backend systems. My journey started at THX Ltd., where I transitioned from intern to full-time engineer, followed by 7 years at Dolby Laboratories, where I advanced to senior software engineer. In Berlin, I contributed to Ableton’s packs infrastructure, focusing on internal web systems for the past 4 years. I’m proficient in Python, Go, and C, with strong experience in Postgres, MongoDB, NGINX, and API frameworks like Flask and FastAPI. While I have deep roots in audio technologies, my current focus is backend engineering in Go, with a long-term goal of leveraging my communication skills and collaborative nature in a management role.
